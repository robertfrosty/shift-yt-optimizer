Chrome extension to hide/reduce the number of videos shown on YouTube.

As the summary above states, this is a simple open-source chrome extension written in vanilla JavaScript, CSS and of course, HTML, using the Chrome Extension format, although shortly there should be an extension for Firefox as well. I noticed a number of other Chrome Extensions that were similar but they all only worked on the homepage, so I decided to make one that worked all over the site, and didn't need the mouse to scroll before it would activate.

I spent a few days looking into how YouTube sets up the front-end of their website, so if anyone has any questions, feel free to shoot me a message. Also, if anyone would like to check out the source-code, or contribute to make it ever better (or fix bugs), you've come to the right place.
